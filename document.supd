 ass_parser is a Rust crate I built to make working with .ass subtitle files a lot easier.

@sub_title {WHY I BUILT IT}
@description {
 I have worked with .ass files before in Rust and found that there aren't many libraries that did what I wanted (Read and Modify .ass files), Convert a .srt (SubRip Subtitle File) to a .ass file.
 }
